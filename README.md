The project about making an adjustable LED flasher circuit. LED flashers are semiconductor integrated circuits used to turn on and off groups of light emitting diodes either sequentially or according to a programmed pattern.

All LED flashers including the solid state flashers, are compatible for use with regular bulbs, as well LED bulbs, mix of LED and regular bulbs.

High efficiency with low voltage makes it easy for LEDs to gain an edge over incandescent lamps, consuming 80% less electrical power.

There are many cheap LED flashers on the market that will simply go up in smoke when you put regular bulbs in.
This is the most efficient and convenient way to upgrade to LED turn signals, but unfortunately many vehicles no longer use replaceable flasher modules.

Feature of CD 4017 IC

Pin out of CD 4017 IC

•	Pin-1: It is the output 5. It goes high when the counter reads 5 counts.

•	Pin-2: It is the output 1. It goes high when the counter reads 0 counts.

•	Pin-3: It is the output 0. It goes high when the counter reads 0 counts.

•	Pin-4: It is the output 2. It goes high when the counter reads 2 counts.

•	Pin-5: It is the output 6. It goes high when the counter reads 6 counts.

•	Pin-6: It is the output 7. It goes high when the counter reads 7 counts.

•	Pin-7: It is the output 3. It goes high when the counter reads 3 counts.

•	Pin-8: It is the Ground pin that should be connected to a LOW voltage (0V).

•	Pin-9: It is the output 8. It goes high when the counter reads 8 counts.

•	Pin-10: It is the output 4. It goes high when the counter reads 4 counts.

•	Pin-11: It is the output 9. It goes high when the counter reads 9 counts.

•	Pin-12: This is divided by 10 output which is used to cascade the IC with another counter to enable counting greater than the range supported by a single IC 4017. By cascading with another 4017 IC, we can count up to 20 numbers. We can increase and increase the range of counting by cascading it with more and more IC 4017s.

Each additional cascaded IC will increase the counting range by 10. However, it is not advisable to cascade more than 3 ICs as it may reduce the reliability of the count due to the occurrence of glitches. If you need a counting range of more than twenty or thirty, I advise you to go with the conventional procedure of using a binary counter followed by a corresponding decoder.

•	Pin-13: This pin is the disabled pin. In the normal mode of operation, this is connected to ground or logic LOW voltage. If this pin is connected to logic HIGH voltage, then the circuit will stop receiving pulses and so it will not advance the count irrespective of several pulses received from the clock.

•	Pin-14: This pin is the clock input. This is the pin from where we need to give the input clock pulses to the IC to advance the count. The count advances on the rising edge of the clock.

•	Pin-15: This is the reset pin that should be kept LOW for normal operation. If you need to reset the IC, then you can connect this pin to HIGH voltage.

•	Pin-16: This is the power supply (Vcc) pin. This should be given a HIGH voltage of 3V to 15V for the IC to function.


Pin out of NE - 555

Pin 1: GND Pin
Ground pin directly connected to the negative terminal of the power source. It is suggested that it should not be connected using any resistor because all the IC will heat up due to stray voltage (it is the occurrence of electrical potential between any two objects that ideally should not have any voltage difference between them at all) in it.

Pin 2: Trigger Pin
A trigger pin is used to activate the IC’s timing cycle for operating. It is a low signal pin and the timer is triggered when the voltage is below one-third of the supply voltage (1/3 V). It is connected to the Inverting input of the comparator inside the IC and accepts negative signals for the operation.

Pin 3: Output Pin
It is the output pin. As the IC triggered the output pin goes high depending on the duration of the timing cycle provided to it. In the case of logic zero o/p; it is a sinking current with voltage greater than zero (0 V). Whereas, in the case of logic high output, it is sourcing current with the output voltage lesser than Vcc.

Pin 4: Reset Pin
The reset pin is used to reset. It should be connected to the positive terminal to work the IC properly. If this pin is grounded, the IC won’t work at all. The required reset voltage is 0.7 volts at a current rating of 0.1mA to work.

Pin 5: Control Voltage
It is used for reliable operation. When not in use, it should be connected to the ground through a capacitor; otherwise, the IC will show erratic responses (deviating from the desired value).

Pin 6: Threshold Pin
It detects when the voltage on the timing capacitor rises above 0.66Vcc. The timing cycle is only completed when the voltage on this particular pin is equal to or greater than 2/3 of Vcc.

Pin 7: Discharge pin
It is used to provide a discharge path from the timing capacitor to the ground when the output is low. The discharging current should be less than 50 mA in order to prevent it from damaged.

Pin 8: Supply Terminal
It is a positive (+ve) terminal that is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply in order to power up. It is used to take power supply voltage from the power source for operating.



Hardware of Flip-flop Project Circuit

To make this adjustable led flasher circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly.

Circuit Connection - Step 1

To make this adjustable led flasher circuit, we need to connect CD-4017 IC with timer IC NE-555.We connect CD-4017 IC 8no, 13no, 15no leg.

Then we connect 2no and 6no leg of timer IC and 4no and 8no leg of timer IC. Connect CD-4017 IC 8no leg with NE-555 IC 1no leg.
And connect NE-555 IC 8no leg with CD-4017 IC 16no leg. 


Circuit Connection - Step 2

Now we connect 10KΩ resistor with 7no leg of timer IC NE-555. Then connect it’s other terminal with same IC 8no leg and 16no leg of CD-4017 IC. We connect 10µf / 25v capacitor with the circuit. Connect this capacitor positive leg with 6no leg of timer IC and it’s negative terminal with 1no leg of timer IC.

Circuit Connection - Step 3

Now we need to connect Ceramic Capacitor – 100 nf with the circuit. We connect this ceramic capacitor with 5no leg of timer IC and it’s other terminal with 1no leg of timer IC. To adjust flash, now we need to connect a potentiometer. 
We connect it’s one terminal with 6no leg and it’s other terminal with 7no leg of timer IC.


Circuit Connection - Step 4

To make this flasher circuit, we are using 40 pieces LED light. We connect all LED negative terminal. Then connect it’s negative terminal with 1no leg of timer IC. This is a 10 channel adjustable led flasher. For this, we divide this 40 LEDs  by 10. Then each side will get 4 led and we connect this 4 led positive leg.


Circuit Connection - Step 5

Now we connect 1st channel led light with 3no leg, 2nd channel led light with 2no leg, 3rd channel led light with 4no leg, 4th channel led light with 7no leg, 5th channel led light with 10 no leg, 6th channel led light with 1no leg, 7th channel led light with 5no leg, 8th channel led light with 6no leg, 9th channel led light with 9 no leg and 10th channel led light with 11no leg of CD-4017 IC.


Circuit Connection - Step 6

To operate this LED flasher circuit, we need to connect a power supply circuit. For power supply, we are using DC-12v. Connect DC-12v positive cable with 8no leg of timer IC and it’s negative terminal with 1no leg of timer IC.
